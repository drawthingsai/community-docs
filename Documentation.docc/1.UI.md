## [old version]First section will be all about UI of Draw Things app


![First section is about UI of Draw Things app](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1058172691309404170/1058175920176898098/IMG_8831.png?ex=6606079f&is=65f3929f&hm=2a12d7fd47c5e3d94b0483cf1dd55435d60a97d0ba25aed06f725b1b654d6946&)

This is basic tutorial explaining UI of Draw Things app with some tips. The app is under active development so expect some things can change in future and other can be added. Experiment with the settings and tools! You cannot do anything wrong.  For prompt inspiration check internet, for example (https://lexica.art/). 

Prompt window - if you slide it to the left, you will see window for negative prompt. In prompt, you can use (something) to emphasize the text, make it more important. If you use [something], you will de-emphasize and make it less important. You can multiple it by adding more (((something))) or write (something:2). 

1 - This button will let you start a new project, it’s mean it will reset all your prompt history and all your picture history, other settings will stay untouched. Now you can rename your project, load your old project or export it. 

2 - This menu will let you quickly set strength in 10% increments. You can find description about strength in settings (5). In short, 100% will generate totally new image, 0% change nothing. Changing this is most important for img2img or inpainting.

3 - Seed number. Find description in settings (5). If click the button, it will generate new random number. If you long press/right click it, it will select the numbers and you can manually change number or paste number you already copied before.

4 - In this menu you can change resolution of your image. For most models 512x512 is best one. Some models like Generic HD (Stable diffusion 2.0 768-v) are best with 768x768. If you generate in different resolutions then recommended for selected model (every model is trained for some selected resolutions), you can expect some problems like duplication, bad generated images, etc.

5 - Settings button. Inside you can set everything for the app and read a lot of description about functions. 

6 - Save button. If you click it, it will automatically save current generated picture in your photos. If you long press/right click it, it will let you choose where you want to save the picture.

7 - Share button, same like share button in iOS. Airdrop, share to other apps etc.

8 - This button will select all text in your prompt window, so you can easily replace it, delete it… It will save you few clicks.
If the words get orange color, it’s signaling it’s more then 75 words, it was prompt limit before and now it’s mean the orange words can be on the image or not, because the prompt is too long. 

9 - Cog button, now you can easily start script (predefined settings) with one click. Later this menu will be customizable, so you can set your own settings and with one click generate picture with that settings.

10 - Generate button, when you click it, it will generate picture with your prompt and all what is set in your settings (5). When you will long press, it will let you generate more images (batch generating), all settings will be same, only seed will be different for each picture. First one will generate image with seed you see in seed (3), other will be random. Also, it is deterministic for batch generation. From the same first-image seed, you will also end up with the same second-image - n-th image seeds. So don’t forget to click seed button, or the first image will be same like your last one if you already generate one. 
11 - Prompt history slider. If you will move the slider to the left, you will go back in history of all your prompt changes.

12 - Picture history slider, if you will move the slider to the left, you will go back in history of all your images you generate, including all your changes in pictures you generate, like using magic wand (13) eraser (15) brush (16) etc. 

13 - Magic wand, if selected, it will let you quickly select objects, like person, or some object of similar color. After you can use eraser (15) brush (16) in that marked areas. Sometimes it can be inaccurate. 

14 - Hand, if you select this tool, you can move the picture in picture window. Useful for example if you generate square 512x512 portrait picture with person and you want to generate bottom of the person body, you can select 512x768 resolution first and after select hand tool and move generated picture up, select inpainting model and click generate, it will try to fill the bottom empty place. If you hold generate button (10) you can select more pictures and you will get more variations. After you can use picture history slider (12) and check quickly which one you like. 

15 - Eraser tool. When you already import or generate image and you want to change some part of the image, you can use this tool for inpainting. When you hold the button, you can use this tool for cleaning what you erase before. Select area, select inpainting model, change your prompt and hit generate. Don’t forget what is write about strength above in this tutorial. Long press/right click change eraser to clean already masked area.

16 - Brush tool. You can draw something in the picture area, for example sketch tree, mountain and person. After write in your prompt “person staying in front of mountain beside tree” and if you will be lucky, generated picture will place the objects where you sketch them. When you will long press/right click the button, you can select colors. 

17 - New canvas button (before Trash button), let you only clean the canvas window. Even you clean it, you can find pictures you clean under history button (19) or picture history slider (12). Is not delete button from history. 

18 - Camera button, if you click it, it will let you choose picture to import from your gallery. If you long press/right click it, it will let you paste image you copy to clipboard before or work with masking/depth map. If you want insert non square image, don’t forget to change resolution (4) first to match the aspect ratio of imported image. 

19 - History. It will show you all history of your generated images and all changes you do for them with other tools. When long press/right click on picture here, you can delete that picture from history. There are the buttons, from left whole history with all edits, middle is tree history showing history from last editing and generation and coffee button for show only generated images.
