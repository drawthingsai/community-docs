F_R_O_S_T_Y


When you click the model menu, you will find list of prepared models. They are functional and already prepared for usage. Always let the app download all the files(don‚Äôt close the app to the background on iOS), or it can cause problems. Models can be between 800MB for 8-bit models, 1,8GB for normal 1.5 models to almost 10GB for SDXL model. 

When you click Manage  new window will open and you will see list of models for download/delete, three dots for export and create 8-bit model. In this window you can select external folder for your models. 

At the bottom, next icon is Import model , where you can manually import models. Read the description carefully . You can download models for example from civitai website or use the green play button beside download model, where you select draw things and it will open this import model window automatically and prefill some settings. If the model have external VAE(it is not baked inside the model already), don‚Äôt forget to download it first, after insert the model for import and insert the downloaded VAE and after click import. 

Last right button is about Model mixing . Here you can mix more models together and create your own mix.

Weighted sum: you select two or more models and combine them together, like Model 1 Generic 1.5 model, model 2 Anything V3. For generic you will choose 0,3, Anything will be set automatically to 0,7. This mean final model will be 30% from generic and 70% from Anything. 
Add difference: when you want to make quick inpainting model from other models, Model 1 must be inpainting model 1.5 (because you will add difference in this model). Model 2 will be the model you want to add inside inpainting, so for example Anything V3. For Model 3 is important to find base model. It must be the model Model 2 is based (civitai showing this information for most models here in description). So anything is based on model generic 1.5, so Model 3 must be generic 1.5. Now you can experiment for best results, try to set 0,8 for Model 2 and try it. If you don‚Äôt like the results, try lower or rise the number and try again.


## [old version]Models importing

For Lora models, process is almost same, but you import it under Lora models list, not under normal model list. If you want import your own model which is not in model list(there are already models for pix2pix, depth2img, inpainting etc., so you don‚Äôt need to import them, choose from the in app list), you must click settings button, after model menu (1), select Customize (2) and here it‚Äôs important to read descriptions of all settings. 
There are three ways how to import custom model. First you need to find website providing them like (https://civitai.com/) or (https://huggingface.co/) or many others. 

After you can choose how to import model in Draw Things. 

![import](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1058172691309404170/1059118667721347113/IMG_8946.jpg?ex=6609759f&is=65f7009f&hm=9ae2de67300736500bbd555b363de23a02aa2e743bc4a8db63287d00abf050c9&)

First way is from (https://civitai.com/) there is official support for importing models to Draw Things. If you click the green play button you can directly import it inside Draw Things app. It will open Draw things app with dialog to download it. 

Second way is download the model, above you can see how it looks (1) and (üëç). You need to see the window for download (2). This is important! If you click download, the file will download inside Files app (or the folder in your macOS where you normally download files from internet). Here, after download you need to move the files inside My phone/Draw Things/Downloads as you can see above. For Mac Downloads folder is there:

###Directory of DT for macOS  

/Users/yourusername/Library/Containers/com.liuliu.draw-things/Data
or
user/Library/Containers/Draw Things/Data/Documents/Models
maybe you need to enable viewing hidden folders with cmd+shift+.
or
you can directly put it under ~/Downloads of your home directory, it will first ask for permission and then you can import the model. 

Third is copy link and insert it to Draw Things model import. Process is similar, but you don‚Äôt click Download, however you need to copy the link in your clipboard. As you can see above, if you copy link for model from (‚ùå) it won‚Äôt work, because you copy link of website only! Every time make sure you copy link from (1) or (üëç).

It‚Äôs easy, when you click some link and it ask you if you want to download it, you can copy same link in your clipboard and paste it in Draw Things. 

Draw Things will download the model from link and after you can import it. 

After successful import, Draw Things will ask you if you want to delete the downloaded model (not the imported), if you click yes, it will clean Downloads folder for you, so you don‚Äôt need to go here and manually delete the downloaded model.

###Changing model name and some details after importing

You can download some app for editing, for example Documents by Readdle and go to DT folder, models and here you can find custom.json file. If you look inside, you will see descriptions about models you imported. So if you feel like expert, you can edit them. But for your safety, backup the original file first before editing. 

And small tip if you want to save space. As you can see above in picture from Files app, there is lot of untitled SQLite files. They are created every time you click Start a new project. It‚Äôs history files and if you don‚Äôt plan to use them, you can delete them all to save space. 


###Deleting models

If you want to delete models, soon there will be way to delete them from Draw Things app. Now you must visit Files app as you can see in picture above, My phone/Draw Things/Models and here you can delete them. You can sort the files inside Models folder by time when you click the three dots in right top corner. Every model have 2 or more files, one will be under 2 GB and other somewhere around 500 MB. You can delete the pairs and when you will start Draw Things the deleted model won‚Äôt show in model list. 

###Model mixing tutorial

If you want to mix models, you must go to settings, open menu for models and click the first button ‚ÄúCustomize‚Äù. At the bottom you can see two buttons, if you select right one, you will enter the model mixing screen. 

Weighted sum: you select two or more models and combine them together, like Model 1 Generic 1.5 model, model 2 Anything V3. For generic you will choose 0,3, Anything will be set automatically to 0,7. Is mean final model will be 30% from generic and 70% from Anything. 

Add difference: when you want to make quick inpainting model from other models, Model 1 must be inpainting model 1.5 (because you will add difference in this model). Model 2 will be the model you want to add inside inpainting, so for example Anything V3. For Model 3 is important to find base model. It must be the model Model 2 is based (civitai showing this information for most models here in description). So anything is based on model generic 1.5, so Model 3 must be generic 1.5. Now you can experiment for best results, try to set 0,8 for Model 2 and try it. If you don‚Äôt like the results, try lower or rise the number and try again.
